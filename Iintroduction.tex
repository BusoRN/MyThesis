In this part of the thesis the hardware that has been designed in this system is explained. 
%It covers the sensors conditioning and the driver for the electrovalves as well as the \textit{DC-DC} converter which supplies the electrovalves when the $12\ V$ ones have to be used. has been request in order to use the system with two different kind of electrovalves, and which supplies them
The design specification for this part are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item make a sensor conditioning for pH and temperature sensors, see (Sec.\ref{phcon}) and (Sec.\ref{tempcon}) for more details;
	\item make a driver for electrovalves which must be able to drives two different kinds of electrovalves, both of them require $80\ mA$ but one type at $24\ V$ while the other one at $12\ V$. To fulfill this aim a \textit{DC-DC} converter has been designed, as well. See (Sec.\ref{sec:electrovalves}) for more details;
	\item make a \textit{PCB}  which supports and connects all the previous components and that is a \textit{capes} for the Beaglebone Black,  it has to be wedged on top of it, see (Chap.\ref{cha:PCB}) for more details.
\end{itemize}
